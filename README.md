## Movies recommendation system project ðŸŽ¬
- What are we doing ? Developping a Movie Recommendation System
- Who are we ? Master students at the UniBE and UniFR in Bioinformatics
- Why are we doing this porject ? This project allows us to implement our knowledge of programming in Python acquired during these first two semesters of the master's degree.
- For who ? This project will help any movie lover to find their best future movies to enjoy/entertain/analyze using their personal taste

### Movie Input and Preferences
Allow users to input movies they have watched along with their ratings. Users can also input their favorite genres, actors, or directors to customize their recommendations.

### Movie Recommendation Algorithm
Develop a basic recommendation algorithm that suggests new movies based on user preferences and ratings. Retrieve and display recommended movies along with their details.

### Data Visualization and User Trend Analysis
Provide users with visualizations of their movie data, such as a breakdown of movies by genre, actor, or director. Allow users to analyze trends in their movie preferences and discover new content that aligns with their interests.

### Link to our Roadmap : https://github.com/Les-eaux/Project_AdvancedPython/blob/main/ROADMAP.md
