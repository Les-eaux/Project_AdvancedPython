## Movies recommendation system project ðŸŽ¬

### Movie Input and Preferences
Allow users to input movies they have watched along with their ratings. Users can also input their favorite genres, actors, or directors to customize their recommendations.

### Movie Recommendation Algorithm
Develop a basic recommendation algorithm that suggests new movies based on user preferences and ratings. Retrieve and display recommended movies along with their details.

### Data Visualization and User Trend Analysis
Provide users with visualizations of their movie data, such as a breakdown of movies by genre, actor, or director. Allow users to analyze trends in their movie preferences and discover new content that aligns with their interests.
