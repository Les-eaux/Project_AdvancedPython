## Movies recommendation system project üé¨
Welcome on our repository! You are probably here because you struggle to find a movie to watch tonight, don't worry we are here to help! üçø

First of all, who is "we"? 
[_We_](members.txt) are master students from UniBe and UniFr in Bioinformatics. 
For one of our lecutres, we need to do a Python project, and we decided to help _you_ to find the perfect movie to watch, based on your preferences. 

### Movie Input and Preferences
Allow users to input movies they have watched along with their ratings. Users can also input their favorite genres, actors, or directors to customize their recommendations.

### Movie Recommendation Algorithm
Develop a basic recommendation algorithm that suggests new movies based on user preferences and ratings. Retrieve and display recommended movies along with their details.

### Data Visualization and User Trend Analysis
Provide users with visualizations of their movie data, such as a breakdown of movies by genre, actor, or director. Allow users to analyze trends in their movie preferences and discover new content that aligns with their interests.

### [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)
Our roadmap is essential in the organization and placement of the various tasks that will be added as the project progresses.
Feedback is welcome, it will be used to obtain external opinions in order to improve the implementation of the project.
