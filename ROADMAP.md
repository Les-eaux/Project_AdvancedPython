# Movies recommendation system project ðŸŽ¬ (Name ?)
First of all, we wanted to offer you a warm welcome to a project that is close to our hearts: (Name ?)
A project from bioinformaticians students of the Universities of Bern and Fribourg : LÃ©o, Oriane, Michael and Reda

## Data collection
- Collect movie data from public datasets
- Preprocess the data to clean any inconsistencies or missing values
- Structure the data into a suitable format for analysis and recommendation

## User input and preferences
- Implement a user interface for users to input movies they've watched along with ratings
- Allow users to specify favorite genres, actors, or directors to customize their recommendations
- Store user preferences and ratings in a database or file for future reference

## Recommendation Algorithm Development
- Implement a basic recommendation algorithm
- Utilize movie features like genre, actors, directors to recommend similar movies

## Movie Recommendation System Implementation
- Develop the backend system that integrates the recommendation algorithm with user input and preferences
- Display recommended movies along with their details like title, genre, rating, etc
- Allow users to interact with the system to view and explore recommended movies

## Data Visualization and User Trend Analysis
- Create visualizations of user movie data using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn
- Generate plots and charts to illustrate trends in movie preferences by genre, actor, director, etc
- Implement interactive features for users to explore and analyze their movie data

## Testing and Optimization
- Test the recommendation system with different user inputs and preferences
- Optimize the system's performance by refining the recommendation algorithm and user interface
